NALSD, also known as non-abstract large system design. : to assess, design, and evaluate large systems.
- Practical
- Concrete

Combines:
+ Capacity planning
+ Component isolation
+ Graceful system degradation

High Available Production Systems

Phase1: Technical design
- Is it possible? Will the design even work?
- Can we do better? Can we make it faster, simpler, or cheaper?

Phase2: Scaling up ::: What if you suddenly add a million users to the system? How will the system be able to accommodate a random increase in users?
- Is it feasible? Will it work at scale? Is it cost-effective?
- Is ti resilient? What happens if the database goes down?
- Can we do better? Are there changes or additions that we need to make?

"do one thing and do it well" philosophy
