#########GIT LAB file:

Here's a .gitlab-ci.yml file to implement the CI/CD pipeline:
YAML
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy-staging
  - automated-testing
  - deploy-prod

variables:
  MAVEN_CLI_OPTS: "--batch-mode"
  MAVEN_ARTIFACT_ID: "my-app"
  KUBE_CONFIG: "$KUBE_CONFIG_FILE"
  STAGING_NAMESPACE: "staging"
  PROD_NAMESPACE: "production"

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - mvn clean package $MAVEN_CLI_OPTS
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - target/${MAVEN_ARTIFACT_ID}.jar

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - mvn test $MAVEN_CLI_OPTS
  dependencies:
    - build

deploy-staging:
  stage: deploy-staging
  script:
    - kubectl config use-context $KUBE_CONFIG
    - kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n $STAGING_NAMESPACE
  dependencies:
    - test

automated-testing:
  stage: automated-testing
  script:
    - cd selenium-tests
    - mvn test $MAVEN_CLI_OPTS
  dependencies:
    - deploy-staging
  allow_failure: true

deploy-prod:
  stage: deploy-prod
  script:
    - kubectl config use-context $KUBE_CONFIG
    - kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n $PROD_NAMESPACE
  dependencies:
    - automated-testing
  when: manual
  allow_failure: false
Explanation:
Build Stage: Uses Maven to build the Java application.
Test Stage: Runs unit tests using Maven.
Deploy Staging Stage: Deploys the application to the staging environment using Kubernetes.
Automated Testing Stage: Runs automated tests using Selenium.
Deploy Prod Stage: Manually deploys the application to the production environment.
Requirements:
Maven installed on the runner.
Kubernetes CLI installed and configured.
deployment.yaml file in the repository's root.
selenium-tests directory containing Selenium tests.
Tips:
Use environment variables to store sensitive information.
Use dependencies to ensure stage ordering.
Use allow_failure to handle non-critical stages.
Use when: manual for manual approval before deploying to production.
Additional Files Needed:
deployment.yaml: Kubernetes deployment configuration.
selenium-tests/pom.xml: Maven configuration for Selenium tests.
This pipeline assumes a basic GitLab CI/CD setup. You may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements.
######################Jenkins groovy
Explanation:
Build Stage: Uses Maven to build the Java application.
Test Stage: Runs unit tests using Maven.
Deploy Staging Stage: Deploys the application to the staging environment using Kubernetes.
Automated Testing Stage: Runs automated tests using Selenium.
Promote to Production Stage: Manually promotes the application to the production environment.
Requirements:
Maven installed on the Jenkins agent.
Kubernetes CLI installed and configured.
deployment.yaml file in the Jenkins workspace.
selenium-tests directory containing Selenium tests.
Kubernetes configuration stored in Jenkins credentials.
Tips:
Use environment variables to store sensitive information.
Use archiveArtifacts to store build artifacts.
Use input step for manual approval before deploying to production.
Additional Configuration:
Install Kubernetes plugin in Jenkins.
Configure Kubernetes credentials in Jenkins.
Create a deployment.yaml file for Kubernetes deployment.
Security Considerations:
Store sensitive information (e.g., Kubernetes credentials) securely.
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Kubernetes deployment.
This pipeline assumes a basic Jenkins setup. You may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements.
Alternative: Using Jenkins UI
You can also create the pipeline using the Jenkins UI:
Create a new pipeline.
Add stages and steps using the pipeline syntax.
Configure Kubernetes deployment using the Kubernetes plugin.
Note: The Jenkinsfile is a Groovy script that defines the pipeline. You can store it in your repository's root.
