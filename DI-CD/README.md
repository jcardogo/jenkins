Pipeline: secuence of steps
Artifacts: Any files generated part of the pipeline
 - Compiled version of the code
 - log files 
 - documentation files 
Security on pipelines is key:
 - all credentials and authentication methods used on the pipeline should be carefully managed
 - Always have a plan to recover  your access in case your pipeline gets compromised

## Configulation file for the pipeline:
  - yaml file

Merge commits: All commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch

Pipelines: The specific steps that need to run to obtain the desired result
