Trubleshooting and debugging 
 - Binary Search
 Troubleshooting: when we are solving issues on the system runing the program
 debugging: when we are solving issues on program's code
###Tools:
####Network connections: 
  - tcpdump
  - wireshark 
strace
ltrace
###Problem Solving
1) Getting Information (What and when it happened)
1.1) have a Reproduction Case:  is a clear description of how and when the problem appears
2) Finding the root cause of the problem (triggers). Hint: document the process [Hardware, software, configuration]
3) Remediation on short, intermediate and long term and document them.

###Silently crashing application
ltrace: trace libraries calls 
strace: trace system calls 
- strace ./application
System calls are the calls that the programs running on our computer make to the running kernel.
- less: to navigate to extense text logs
- strace -o : to store the output into a file and then browse the contents of that file.
strace -o filename_for_logs.trace ./appliation.py
less filename_for_logs.trace

Reproduction Case: A reproduction case is a way to verify if the problem is present or not.
- check logs foles 
- Isolate conditions that lead us to the error 

####Fetching the root cause:
iotop, which is a tool similar to top that lets us see which processes are using the most input and output. 
iostat / vmstat : these tools show statistics on the input/output operations and the virtual memory operations.
ionice: to make our backup system reduce its priority to access the disk and let the web services use it too.
----Network usage
iftop: yet another tool similar to top that shows the current traffic on the network interfaces.
 The rsync command, which is often used for backing up data, includes a -bwlimit, just for this purpose. If that option isn't available, we can use a program like Trickle to limit the bandwidth being used.
---COmpression algorithm, is consuming all the processing power
we can use the nice commmand to reduce the priority of a specific process and accessing the CPU
