I am editing the README file. Adding some more details about the project description.

DevOps principles
DevOps has the following key principles:

Collaboration: The main purpose of DevOps is to promote and facilitate collaboration among teams.

Automation: Each part of the development process is automated. This helps make the building, testing, deploying, and monitoring of the code more stable and predictable.

Continuous improvement: Teams should always be looking for opportunities to improve the process, tools, and communication between teams.

Customer mindset: Teams should remember that the software they are developing will be used by customers. Listen to customers and take their feedback into consideration to continually create an improved software program. You want to develop software that is fun to use.

Create with the end in mind: Teams should understand customer needs and pain points, and they should develop solutions that solve real problems.



Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

DevOps is a methodology that replaced the traditional way of developing and deploying code. DevOps is a collaborative effort between the development and operations teams. They work in an agile environment to eliminate the communication gap between the two teams. This allows the software to be developed more quickly and reliably. Automation is a key element through the entire DevOps process. DevOps has five key principles that include: collaboration, automation, continuous improvement, customer mindset, and end-goal-focused creation. For DevOps to be successful, team members need to adjust their mindsets and be open to working in a collaborative way with new processes.

A service-level agreement (SLA) acts as a promise and can be a legally binding agreement between a vendor and its clients or users. It includes the sale contract outlining the minimum level of performance for the client’s or user’s application, and it includes the consequences if there’s a breach in the contract. Metrics in the SLA include uptime, responsiveness, and responsibilities. 

Service-level objectives (SLOs) are found within an SLA and focus on specific metrics like uptime and response time. They should be measurable and clearly written. SLOs set the customers’ expectations and communicate to the IT and DevOps teams the goals they need to achieve. 

Service-level indicators (SLIs) measure the performance of an application against the SLOs at any given time. Monitoring SLIs provides you with valuable insights on whether your application is meeting the objective or violating the SLA. SLIs help development and operation teams analyze and determine if the promise — or promises — they made to their customers or users are upheld.

An error budget is the maximum amount of time a software program can fail and still be in compliance with the SLO. This value is typically represented in percentage form and is the difference between 100% and the SLO percentage value. For example, if an SLO states that a website should function properly 99.8% of the time, then the error budget is only 0.2%. DevOps teams use their error budget time either to focus on the reliability of the program or to take risks in the program (if it is running smoothly).
