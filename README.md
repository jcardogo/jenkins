I am editing the README file. Adding some more details about the project description.

DevOps principles
DevOps has the following key principles:

Collaboration: The main purpose of DevOps is to promote and facilitate collaboration among teams.

Automation: Each part of the development process is automated. This helps make the building, testing, deploying, and monitoring of the code more stable and predictable.

Continuous improvement: Teams should always be looking for opportunities to improve the process, tools, and communication between teams.

Customer mindset: Teams should remember that the software they are developing will be used by customers. Listen to customers and take their feedback into consideration to continually create an improved software program. You want to develop software that is fun to use.

Create with the end in mind: Teams should understand customer needs and pain points, and they should develop solutions that solve real problems.
