Design Choices and Trade-Offs
    - Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple web servers for scalability and fault tolerance.
    - Web Server: Uses NGINX or Apache for handling HTTP requests and serving static content.
    - Application Server: Node.js handles dynamic requests, business logic, and database interactions.
    - Database: MySQL or MongoDB chosen for scalability, performance, and data structure flexibility.
    - Cache Layer: Redis or Memcached improves performance by caching frequently accessed data.
    - Search Engine: Elasticsearch provides efficient product search and filtering capabilities.
    - Payment Gateway: Integrates Stripe or PayPal for secure payment processing.
    - CDN: Cloudflare accelerates content delivery and enhances security.
Trade-Offs
    - Complexity vs. Scalability: Additional components increase complexity but enable scalability.
    - Cost vs. Performance: Higher-performance components (e.g., Elasticsearch) may increase costs.
    - Data Consistency vs. Availability: Eventual consistency chosen for higher availability.
Scalability Strategies
    - Horizontal Scaling: Add more web servers, application servers, or database replicas.
    - Vertical Scaling: Upgrade individual component resources (e.g., CPU, RAM).
    - Caching: Implement caching layers to reduce database queries.
    - Load Balancing: Distribute traffic efficiently across components.
Security Considerations
    - Encryption: Implement SSL/TLS encryption for secure data transmission.
    - Access Control: Enforce role-based access control and authentication.
    - Regular Updates: Stay up-to-date with security patches and updates.
Monitoring and Maintenance
    - Logging: Implement centralized logging for error tracking and analysis.
    - Monitoring Tools: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and New Relic for performance monitoring.
    - Automated Deployments: Implement CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployments.
This architecture provides a scalable and performant foundation for an e-commerce platform, balancing complexity, cost, and security considerations.
