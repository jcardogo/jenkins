A scalable system is scalable
Configuration Manager:
- Manually = Unmanaged configurations
- What is required for a computer to work properly

Manager COnfiguration:
- Each server/computer = node
- Aint to solve manual configuration problems
- You edit the rules and the confmanager apply it to the servers

Say you found one bug on one computer that could be pressent on multiple machines.

popular systems include:
 - Puppet: ensure system consistency thourgh its catalog-based aproach
 - Chef: 
 - Ansible: Relies on SSH or other API for system management. YAML playbooks 
 - CFEngine.
 - Terraform: Provisioning Cloud resources
 - 

Infrastructure as code paradigm.

PUPPET: 
2005 
puppet6, 2018
Puppet agent: manage the list of rules
Puppet master: request the list of rules and apply it to the machine

DSL: Domain Specific Language, we can do much more complex operations using Puppet's domain-specific language.

When and how appplicate configurations.

- Variables
- Conditionals
- Statements

Facts: characteristics of the system, sent from agent to compare with masters configuration to compare.

Puppet is a declarative code language: in this case we declare the expected result and not the procedure to follow.

Idempotent action can be performed over an over again without changing the system after the first time the action was performed, and with no unintended side effects.

#### Stateless:
each run is independent, as there is not state kept between runs of the agent.
Each run is just acting with the facts poked from the agent and compared to the masters configured file

#######Test and Repair
Each time a puppet action is run, it test the condition and execute required reparation to achieve the expected condition.

####catalog
is the list of rules that are generated for one specific computer once the server has evaluated all variables, conditions, and functions.

When we reference a resource relationship from another file, we capitalize the resource name being referenced.
