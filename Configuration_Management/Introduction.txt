puppet:  the current industry standard for configuration management
Platform as a Service or PaaS: is when a Cloud provider offers a preconfigured platform to the customer. 
Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS: is when a Cloud provider supplies only the bare-bones computing experience. Generally, this means a virtual machine environment and any networking components needed to connect virtual machines, the Cloud provider won't care what you're using the VMs for
web server responding to queries from external users, we might care about the number of queries that can be answered in a second which is called queries per second or QPS

####Cloud:
There are a couple of different ways that we can scale our service in the Cloud:
    - horizontally, we add more nodes into the pool that's part of a specific service.
    Example: Apache supports 150 concurrent connections, if you need 1.500 connections at the same time we can deploy 10 apache servers and distribute the load across them.
    - Vertically, it means you're making your nodes bigger. When we say bigger here we're talking about the resources assigned to the nodes like memories, CPU, and disk space.
    Example: you have a caching server and you notice it's using 95 percent of the available memory. You can deal with that by adding more memory to the node.
Autoscaling
- make sure you set a reasonable quotas for your auto scaling systems.

PaaS: Some popular managed web application platforms include Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft App Service, and Google App Engine.
Containers: are applications that are packaged together with their configuration and dependencies.

*public Clouds: services provided to you by a third party. 
*private Clouds: when your company owns the services and the rest of your infrastructure, whether that's on-site or in a remote data center.
*hybrid Clouds:  is a mixture of both public and private Clouds.
*multi-Clouds: is a mixture of public and/or private Clouds across vendors AWS + AZURE + GCP + OnPrem
