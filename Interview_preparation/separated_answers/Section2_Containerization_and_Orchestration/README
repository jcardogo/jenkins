Steps to run:
Build the Docker image: docker build -t <your-docker-image-name> .
Push the image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub): docker push <your-docker-image-name>
Apply the ConfigMap: kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
Apply the Deployment: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Verify the deployment: kubectl get deployments
Verify the pods: kubectl get pods
Verify the service: kubectl get svc
Replace <your-docker-image-name> with your actual Docker image name.
Please note that this is a basic example. You should consider security best practices, such as using secrets for sensitive data and configuring resource limits for your pods.
