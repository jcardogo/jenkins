Additional Considerations
- Schedule the Bash script using cron jobs.
- Run the Python scripts as systemd services or using a scheduler like Apache Airflow.
- Monitor script logs and adjust configuration as needed.
- Implement error handling and alerting mechanisms.
- Use secure practices for authentication and authorization.
By automating these tasks, you'll improve efficiency, reduce downtime, and enhance overall system reliability.
