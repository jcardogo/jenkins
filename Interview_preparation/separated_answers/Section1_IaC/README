Steps to run:

1) Initialize Terraform: terraform init
2) Apply Terraform configuration: terraform apply
3) Update Ansible inventory file with EC2 instance's public IP
4) Run Ansible playbook: ansible-playbook -i hosts ec2_config.yml

Replace <EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>, <PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY>, and your_key_name with your actual values.
Please note that this is a basic example. You should consider security best practices, such as using more secure passwords and restricting access to your resources.
